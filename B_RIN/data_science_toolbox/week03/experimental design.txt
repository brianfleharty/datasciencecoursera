formulate question in advanced

population -> probability -> (sample) to calculate descriptive statistics  -> inferential

confounding shoe size and age and literacy - pay attention to all variables

correlation is not causation

randomization and blocking
	fix variable
	stratify - mix and match
	randomize

prediction vs inference
	for prediction populations need to be separated

Randomization helps if there is confounding variable
	
prediction key quantities
	sensitivity Pr		++	test disease
	specificity		--	
	positive predictive	++	disease test		
	negative predicative	--
	accurace		correct

data dredging changing question untill you get good results and ignoring the previous questions

good experiments
	have replication
	measure variability
	generalize the problem you care about
	are transparent

prediction is not inference
	both can be important
beware of data dredging
