descriptive - describe data
	first kind of analysis
	census data and google ngram viewer
	description and interperation are different steps
	descriptions usually can not be generalized without additional statistical modeling

exploratory - find relationships you dont know about
	models are good for finding new connections
	useful for finding future studies
	not the final say
	not for generalizing or predicting
	correlation does not imply causation
		brain activity locations
		star behavior


Inferential - use small sample data to say something about a bigger population
	commonly the goal of statistical modeling
	involves estimating the quantity you are interested in and the uncertainty about your estimate
	depends on population and sampling scheme
		effect of air polution on life expectancy

predictive analysis - use data on some objects to predict values of another object
	even if x predicts y it does not mean x causes y
	accuracy depends on measuring the right variables
	more data and simple model work well
	prediction is hard especially about future references
		fivethirtyeight election prediction
		target figured out a girl was pregnant

causal analysis - find out how changing one sample will affect another
	usually randomized studies to id causation
	if non-randomized will be compicated and sensitive to assumptions
	causal relationships are ususally defined as average effects
	causal models are gold standard
		fecal transplants

mechanistic analysis - understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other 
		       variables for individual objects
	hard to infer except simple situations
	usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations (engineering)
	only random component of the data is error in measurment
	if equations are know but the parameters are no they may be infered with data analysis
		changes in concrete design vs function
